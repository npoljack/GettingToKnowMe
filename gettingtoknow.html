<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Nicole Poljack and I am a senior majoring in Forensic Criminal Investigation. 
After I graduate, I'm planning on <br>going for my masters in Cyber Sceurity. In my free time, I
 pretty much just like to relax and hangout with my friends. I enjoy watching Netflix or movies,
<br>scrolling though Youtube, and doing puzzles. Because COVID has made it difficult to physically 
spend time with friends, my friends and I facetime<br>each other whenever we can. One thing we do 
that I highly recommend is having a powerpoint night. Each person makes and presents a powerpoint 
of whatever topic they choose.</p>

<h3>What I hope to learn from this class</h3>
<ul style=list-style-position:inside;list-style-type:square;>
    <li>Cloud Computing</li>
    <li>Interactive Websites</li>
    <li>Security</li>
  </ul> 
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>Whenever I have some free time, I typically will watch a TV show on Netflix or a movie or play The 
 Sims. This just helps me relax and unwind,<br>especially if I've had a long day. My favorite TV 
 show is Criminal Minds and I really like Marvel movies.<br>Whatever I decide to watch just depends
  on what kind of mood I'm in.</p>
